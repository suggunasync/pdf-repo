What is being changed (in terms the business can understand)?
Restarting and configuring the  production harmony servers  to accomplish  below tasks.
1.       Failover the RHEL cluster  (currently pointing to the secondary ).
          usnencpl025 is the main server and usnencpl026 is the secondary server 
          PGP team will start and stop harmony after HP team is done with the changes in RHEL cluster 
 Move connection changes so that "cluster share" is referenced in the file path statements instead of hardcoded file system names.
3.       The secondary Harmony server does not have the VL Proxy configuration showing so it needs to be manually updated

Why is the change being performed?
Restarting and configuring the  production harmony servers  to accomplish  below tasks 
To do changes below changes in Production Harmony  server.
